## Learning Points
Learn, Adapt, Retry 

When working with AI models you have an option  to train them. There are three roles when  shaping your  ai counterpart as a developer  the system: this is where you give the model direction and a character you can literally tell it who you to be and how to be Then there is the user role who will influence your ai model any way they see fit and lastly the most influential is content and context best practices are to feed the machine prompts behind the scenes these are prompts that user do not see or know about

I want to be able ot create an account so that I can access the site. This requires a signup form requesting username, email and password. I want to log into my account and access features of the website including a firends list, forums and weather search. A sign in page that checks user information is required. I want to also be able to create, view and comment on posts, interacting with the wider community. A post page with input fields for submission and automatic refresh. Continuing with the comunity, I want to see a list of potential friends that I am then able to add to my list.
